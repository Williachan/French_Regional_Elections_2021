# French_Regional_Elections_2021

Really simple notebook to visualize data about the first round of the French regional elections (20/06/2021).
Several data can be displayed, so far only the three first lists in Metropolitan France for each region with the proportions 
in vote numbers are displayed on a folium choropleth map.

It is this way since the choropleth map (folium or even plotly) do not seem to be the most appropriate tools for this project.
A development with Tableau is on going.
